          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Memchess is a two-player turn-based game</li>
            <li>
              It consists of a game of Chess and a game of 8x8 Memory played
              simultaneously
            </li>
            <li>
              Each turn consists of a Chess move and a Memory move. The memory
              move is optional, the turn ends after the chess move.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each piece on the board has a corresponding pair of cards on the
              memory board, except for the king. They are destroyed when a piece
              is captured, or changed when a piece is promoted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matching a pair of cards on the memory board allows the player to
              optionally pick a corresponding piece on the chess board and
              remove it, given that it does not invalidate the chess rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              The memory board contains 4 wildcards, which can be matched with
              any card. Matching two wildcards allows the player to remove any
              piece from the board(except the king).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Winning the game</h2>
          <p>The game ends when one of the following conditions are met:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>A checkmate occurs.</li>
            <li>A stalemate occurs. This results in a draw</li>
            <li>
              All pieces of one player, except the king, are eliminated. The
              other player is decalred as the winner.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Only in timed mode) One of the players runs out of time. In this
              case, the other player is declared winner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Tips</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              If you know the locations of a pair of cards of your color, you
              can match them but not remove any piece to gain an advantage and
              essentially removing the cards for one of your pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can stratigically match cards to remove an opposing piece
              pinning one of your pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can skip playing memory to let your opponent reveal the cards
              for you, if it seems advantageous.
