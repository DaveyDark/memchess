          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Memchess is a two-player turn-based game.</li>
            <li>
              It combines a game of Chess with an 8x8 Memory game, played
              simultaneously.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each turn consists of a Chess move and an optional Memory move.
              The turn ends after the Chess move.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Chess piece has a corresponding pair of cards on the Memory
              board, except for the King. When a piece is captured, its
              corresponding cards are removed. When a piece is promoted, its
              corresponding cards change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matching a pair of cards on the Memory board allows the player to
              optionally remove the corresponding piece on the Chess board, as
              long as it does not break Chess rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Memory board contains four wildcards. Wildcards can match with
              any card. Matching two wildcards allows the player to remove any
              piece from the board, except the King.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Winning the Game</h2>
          <p>The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>A checkmate occurs.</li>
            <li>A stalemate occurs, resulting in a draw.</li>
            <li>
              All pieces of one player, except the King, are eliminated. The
              other player is declared the winner.
            </li>
            <li>
              In timed mode, if a player runs out of time, the other player is
              declared the winner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Tips</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              If you know the locations of a pair of cards of your color, you
              can match them without removing a piece to gain an advantage,
              essentially removing the cards for one of your pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strategically match cards to remove an opposing piece that is
              pinning one of your pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can skip the Memory move to let your opponent reveal cards,
              which might be advantageous for you.
            </li>
